# ALC Concept Satisfiability Inference Engine


This project implements an inference engine for checking the satisfiability of a concept in the ALC logic. The engine leverages the **Tableau method** and incorporates optimizations such as **Blocking** and **Lazy Unfolding** to efficiently determine satisfiability. The user interacts with the engine through a graphical interface, providing the concept and TBox as inputs, and receives results both graphically and textually.

The tableau resulting from the query is graphically represented in RDF format (Turtle notation) and visualized with a specific graph visualization program (graphviz).

## Features
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Users can input the concept either by typing directly or by importing it from a file.
- **TBox Handling:** The TBox is loaded from an OWL serialized file (preferably in Manchester syntax) and is used to verify the satisfiability of the provided concept.
- **Inference Process:** The Tableau-based reasoning process checks whether the given concept is satisfiable concerning the provided TBox.
- **Result Output:** The resulting tableau is saved in both **.rdf** (Turtle syntax) and **.png** format. Additionally, the console shows the translated concept, satisfiability status, and execution time.

## Input

- Concept (C): Input via GUI as Manchester syntax or imported from a file.
- TBox (T): Serialized OWL file in Manchester syntax, placed in the **`ontologies/`** directory. 

The engine uses Tableau-based reasoning to verify satisfiability in the ALC logic, incorporating the following techniques:


## Key Features

### Blocking
Prevents the exploration of redundant branches in the tableau by ensuring that a nodeâ€™s label is checked against its ancestors to detect equivalence.
Optimized using parent references for fast ancestor traversal and condition checks on class assertions.

### Lazy Unfolding
Delays the expansion of certain axioms (like equivalences and subclass assertions) until necessary, improving performance.
Axioms are partitioned into unfoldable and non-unfoldable subsets, and the unfolding is applied lazily during the tableau expansion.
